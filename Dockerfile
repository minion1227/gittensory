# Self-host image for gittensory-api (#980). Runs the SAME Worker handlers on Node via src/server.ts —
# the Cloudflare bindings become self-host adapters (D1 -> node:sqlite, Queue -> in-process). The hosted
# Cloudflare Worker (wrangler) deploy is unaffected. SECRETS ARE NEVER BAKED: supply them at run time via
# the .env file or mounted *_FILE secrets (see docker-compose.yml + .env.example).
