// Centralized moderation-rules engine (generic self-host feature, #selfhost-mod-engine). A single modular
// layer over the three EXISTING anti-abuse mechanisms (contributor cap, blacklist, review-nag) that already
// short-circuit a PR's disposition: every time one of them fires against a non-exempt contributor, it counts
// toward that login's install-wide violation tally (the shared `audit_events` ledger, keyed by actor). At
// >=1 lifetime violation the contributor is labeled with `warningLabel`; at >=`banThreshold` they are labeled
// `bannedLabel` and (when `autoBlacklistOnBan`) auto-added to the existing global contributor blacklist --
// the SAME "permanent two-strikes" enforcement an already-banned login gets.
//
// Config-as-code, layered the same as every other setting: a global default (the whole layer can be off,
// which rules count, the label text, the threshold, whether a ban auto-enforces) with a PER-REPO override
// that can turn the layer off/on for just that repo and override which rules feed IT specifically. NEVER
// hard-coded for any one repo -- a self-hoster's own `.gittensory.yml`/dashboard settings choose everything.
