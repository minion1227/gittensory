/**
 * Resolve an upstream ref (branch/tag) to its immutable HEAD commit SHA — the pin recorded by BOTH the
 * scoring-model refresh (`refreshScoringModelSnapshot`) and the upstream-drift refresh. It was fetched twice per
 * hour (one `GET /repos/{repo}/commits/{ref}` in each of those hourly jobs). This is the single shared resolver so:
 *
 *   - **Dedup:** both jobs issue the identical bare `/commits/{ref}` read through `timeoutFetch`, which the
 *     self-host GitHub response cache serves from its short-TTL `commit` class — so within a window the ref
 *     resolves ONCE (a cache hit for the second job) instead of twice.
 *   - **Budget-gate:** it yields (returns null) when the shared REST budget is at/below the low-water floor, so
 *     this best-effort audit resolve never spends a scarce request during a rate-limit crunch (the same hourly
 *     window where the heavy maintenance fan-out runs).
 *
 * Fail-open: a rate-limit yield, a network/parse error, a non-OK status, or a missing SHA all return null — every
 * caller already treats null as "fall back to the mutable ref", so a resolve failure never blocks the refresh.
